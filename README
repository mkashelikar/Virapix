                            -----------------Steps to run virapix-----------------

1. Ensure that the host system has xguest package installed and xguest user configured. This is a mandatory requirement. The home directory
***must*** be set as /home/xguest.

2. Log in as xguest.

3. Insert the USB key (with virapix suite installed) in any available slot on your system. If autofs has been correctly configured, 
the device will mount automatically. In all other cases, you'll have to mount it manually. Although it'd be most desirable to be able to mount the
device as xguest, the system security policy may not allow so. If that's the case, you'll have to mount the device as root (through command 
su - root). In any event, ensure that the directories rt, rt/home/xguest, and rt/virapix under the mount point are owned and writable by xguest. If 
the device has the appropriate file system (eg. ext4, xfs, jfs etc.), you won't have to worry about this since the installation procedure would have 
taken care of directory ownership. Please consult the documentation for mount and fstab if the owner appears to be somebody other than xguest.

4. If you had to switch to the root login earlier, exit the shell which should return you to xguest login. Assuming the mount point to be 
/mnt/pendrive, run the command /mnt/pendrive/rt/virapix/bin/checkdeps. This will do a quick check for mandatory packages on the host. Although 
virapix suite comes with much of the required software, it still requires the most fundamental packages to be preinstalled on the host machine.
checkdeps will also see whether or not ld.so is stripped. If it is, well, you are out of luck.

5. The configuration for virapix is simple and is stored in virapix/cfg/.virapixrc. It's a text file with format "name = value". There shall be
only one property per line, i.e. shell style "\" for command continuation is not supported. In addition, the length of a line shall not exceed
1024 characters. Comments are marked by hash ("#"), i.e. everything after hash on that line is discarded. Case is ignored and so are white spaces 
except of course the newline character. Information about individual property appears in .virapixrc itself.

6. If all looks well, you are ready to go! Run the command /mnt/pendrive/rt/virapix/bin/vlaunch and you'll be in a new session running entirely in
a virtual machine off the USB key.

7. Few words of caution: 
    ***NEVER*** run virapix directly; always use the script vlaunch provided for the very purpose.
    ***NEVER*** attempt to install any packages when in virapix session; Firefox plugins can be installed though.

8. Before exiting fluxbox session, be sure to close all running applications.

                --------------------------------------- Restrictions --------------------------------------

1. Statically linked applications not supported.
2. ld-linux.so on the host system must ***not*** be stripped. That is, it must contain the full symbol table (.symtab section).
3. Any call to rename() or link() will fail if the source path does not lie on the USB. This is because these system calls don't work across
mount points.
4. A call to symlink() will successfully create the symbolic link at the appropriate location on the USB drive, but if the source file lies on the 
host system then any future writes/modifications using the symbolic link will show in that file. Indeed this is against the very philosophy of the 
virtual machine. This limitation exists with any symlink present on the pendrive and which points to a file on the host machine.
5. Files/directories (on the host) that are unlink()ed/rmdir()ed/rename()d are still available if the application tries to access them again.
This is because only the versions on the pendrive are actually affected; those on the host are untouched. 
6. Similar to (5), system calls that change attributes (chmod(), fsetxattr() etc.) or write to files will fail if the file exists on the host but 
not on the USB device. Of course, this limitation does ***not*** apply to file creation system calls.
7. File paths are restricted to 255 bytes. 
8. The mount point of the USB device needs to be the same across host systems and so should be xguest home directory. That's because applications
hard code these values in the per-user configuration files that they create in the home directory.
9. NIS logins not supported as of now. (The installation script uses /etc/passwd).
10. Packaged for and tested only on Mandriva Linux 2010.0.

Thankfully, (4), (5) and (6) are least likely to occur in practice.
