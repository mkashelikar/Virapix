1. Add a check for xguest user id.
2. Add the ability to run terminal applications (xterm, konsole etc.); they invoke setsid() which fails because virapix makes every application that
it controls a group leader. 
3. Support package upgrade and triggers. Also change packaging strategy.
4. OpenOffice runs with some graphic widgets/icons disabled. This has to be corrected.
5. Be more rigorous with package dependency check. 
6. virapix yet to be tested on 32 bit Linux.
7. In the "file open" dialog box in OpenOffice, the contents of the virtual directory are shown as expected. However, if an absolute path is typed
in the edit box, the "real" directory is exposed. We cannot intercept getdents() since this syscall is used elsewhere too. Need to find a proper 
solution.
8. Should be able to work with stripped ld.so binary as well. Currently this isn't possible. 
9. Relax the restriction of requiring to have the same USB mount point and xguest home directory on all host systems.
10. Audio support.
11. Support on-demand installation of packages (from Firefox for instance) while in session.
12. How to deal with device files opened in write mode or whose attributes are to be changed?
13. Support for distros other than Mandriva.
14. Explore the option of autorun for the USB device.
