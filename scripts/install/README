Welcome to virapix, the virtual desktop software for Linux operating system. Virapix allows you to run desktop environment off a USB key
on any compatible Linux system. Thanks to the virtual machine, any customisation or configuration changes are localised to the USB device
without the application even knowing it. Documents you create or modify also go in to the virtual desktop storage without affecting the host 
system. In other words, your working environment remains the same no matter which machine you work on. You don't need any desktop software on
the host; everything is packaged in virapix suite. However for proper functioning, the host system must have some basic ingredients like X 
server and the associated components, the core runtime libraries like libc, libstdc++, ld.so, pthread etc., bash, tools like grep, sed, not to 
mention scripting facilities like perl and python. Lastly, virapix works only with xguest login which means that the system should have this
package installed as well. The script checkdeps supplied with the suite checks for missing packages.

The suite comprises virapix virtual machine, fluxbox window manager, Open Office and Mozilla Firefox. It's strongly recommended to have
a native Linux file system (eg. ext3, ext4, xfs, jfs etc.) on the USB key. FAT/VFAT won't work because it doesn't support symbolic links.
ntfs-3g on the other hand suffers from the limitation that non-root user cannot mount the file system unless the driver is setuid root. Not
a very appealing idea. Moreover, once ntfs-3g is mounted with the a specific uid, you cannot alter ownership of any of the files or directories.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The software is written and packaged for Mandriva Linux 2010.0 running kernel 2.6.33 on Intel x86_64 platform. Other architectures and 
distros aren't yet supported.

NOTE: To set up xguest login, simply run the command /usr/bin/xguest-add-helper. This of course assumes that xguest package has been installed
on the system. Also verify that the uid for xguest login is the same on all machines (most likely to be 10000). This is a mandatory requirement 
and not a quaint formality: identical uid guarantees that file ownership, permissions and accessibility on the USB device will remain the same on 
any machine you work on. In addition, it's mandatory that the home directory is configured as /home/xguest.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: There ***must*** be an entry for USB mount in /etc/fstab.

A typical entry looks something like this:

LABEL=transcend-jet /mnt/pendrive ext4 users,dev,exec,async,noauto 0 0

A quick description of the fields:

LABEL=transcend-jet - It's a good idea to attach a volume label to the device. The device file associated with the pendrive may not be the same 
everytime and hardcoding it in fstab configuration is not guaranteed to work. For ext4, check the commands mkfs.ext4 and tune2fs.

/mnt/pendrive - This is the directory to mount the file system on.

ext4 - The name of the file system.

users,dev,exec,async,noauto - users (anybody can mount/unmount the device), dev (correctly handle char and block special files), 
exec (support execution of files), async (enable asynchronous IO; this increases the device's life), noauto (enforce explicit mount,
i.e. mount -a won't have any effect).

0 0 - Disable fs dumps (see dump(8)) and also disable fs check during system boot.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: It's strongly recommended to start with a clean, formatted USB pendrive.

To install the software, ***log in as root***, switch to the installation directory on the media and type the command:

./install.sh <mount point>

For the fstab example above, the command will look like:

./install.sh /mnt/pendrive

NOTE: The install script will fail if the pendrive is already mounted. This is to avoid accidental installation on a mounted file system
of the host machine in the event of a wrong mount point being passed to install.sh. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To uninstall the software, ***log in as root***, switch to the installation directory on the media and type the command:

./uninstall.sh <mount point>

The same rules as above apply.
